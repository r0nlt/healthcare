======= Clinical Relevance Analysis =======

Clinical Relevance Metrics (n=500 simulated patients):
------------------------------------------------------------
Treatment                Efficacy Δ     Response Δ     p-value   Significant
------------------------------------------------------------
radiation_only           0.142         31.6%       0.0000    True
chemotherapy_only        0.068         21.2%       0.0000    True
chemoradiation_standard  0.073         16.2%       0.0000    True
chemoradiation_optimized 0.143         23.0%       0.0000    True

Overall Clinical Assessment:
The framework shows clinically significant improvements in treatment efficacy,
particularly for optimized chemoradiation treatment planning.
The greatest impact is seen in treatments that benefit from quantum-informed
timing and synergy optimization.
