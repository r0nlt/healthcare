Radiation-Tolerant Machine Learning Framework
Copyright (c) 2025 Rishab Nuguru

This software was developed by Rishab Nuguru as an original work.

The Radiation-Tolerant Machine Learning Framework is a comprehensive solution for 
implementing fault-tolerant neural networks and machine learning models capable 
of operating reliably in high-radiation environments such as space. This work 
includes novel methods for Health-Weighted Triple Modular Redundancy, 
Approximate TMR, Selective Hardening, and physics-based radiation simulation.

This work represents significant intellectual contribution to the field of 
radiation-tolerant computing and is provided under the MIT license with the
