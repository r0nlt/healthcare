## How Radiation Affects Biological Systems

When ionizing radiation interacts with biological tissue, it can cause several types of damage:

- **Direct DNA Damage**: High-energy particles can directly break DNA strands
- **Indirect Damage via Radiolysis**: Radiation can ionize water molecules, creating reactive oxygen species that damage cells
- **Protein and Membrane Damage**: Structural changes to proteins and cell membranes
- **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: Damage to cellular energy production systems

These effects operate on quantum scales where traditional models often fail to accurately predict outcomes. By incorporating quantum field theory corrections, this framework provides more accurate models for:

- Radiation therapy planning
- Cellular damage prediction
- Therapeutic ratio optimization
- Radiation protection

| 300K | 1.12 | 1.05 | Room temperature |
| 400K | 1.12 | 1.04 | High temperature |

### Linear-Quadratic Model Implementation

The QFT Bridge implements a scientifically validated Linear-Quadratic model for radiation damage with α = 0.3 Gy⁻¹ and β = 0.03 Gy⁻²:

| Dose (Gy) | Radiation Effect | Biological Components Affected |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0.5 | α·D + β·D² | DNA strand breaks, membrane lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage |
| 1.0 | α·D + β·D² | Increasing quadratic component contribution |
| 2.0 | α·D + β·D² | Quadratic component becomes more significant |
| 5.0 | α·D + β·D² with saturation | Biological saturation effects observed |

### Implementation Strategy

The framework implements this cross-domain bridge through:

1. **Unified QFT Base Class**: Core quantum field equations parameterized for both domains
2. **Domain Adapters**: Specialized parameter sets for semiconductor and biological systems
3. **Parameter Conversion Functions**: Mathematical transforms between domains
4. **Scientific Validation Methodology**: Cross-domain comparisons that acknowledge inherent differences
5. **Dose-Dependent Tolerance**: Wider tolerance bounds at higher doses where biological response becomes more complex

```cpp
// Example of cross-domain bridge usage with scientific validation
#include <rad_ml/crossdomain/qft_bridge.hpp>

using namespace rad_ml::crossdomain;

int main() {
    // Create semiconductor parameters
    SemiconductorParameters silicon;
    silicon.energy_gap = 1.12;      // Silicon bandgap
    silicon.feature_size = 15.0;    // nm
    silicon.temperature = 300.0;    // K
    silicon.barrier_height = 3.1;   // Si-SiO₂ barrier height

    // Convert to biological parameters
    BiologicalParameters bio_params = convertToBiological(silicon);

    // Test cross-domain equivalence for multiple doses
    double doses[] = {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0};  // Gy

    for (double dose : doses) {
        bool within_tolerance = testCrossDomainEquivalence(silicon, bio_params, dose);
        std::cout << "Cross-domain validation "
                  << (within_tolerance ? "PASSED" : "FAILED")
                  << " at " << dose << " Gy" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Scientific Validation

The QFT Bridge Model has been validated against:
- Theoretical quantum field expectations
- Experimental radiation damage data
- Semiconductor single event upset (SEU) data
- Biological Linear-Quadratic model predictions
- Cross-domain validation with appropriate scientific tolerances

Current validation approach:
- Scientific comparison with order-of-magnitude tolerances appropriate for cross-domain validation
- Dose-dependent tolerance thresholds to account for increasing biological complexity at higher doses
- Trend agreement rather than exact numerical matching, as dictated by scientific principles
- Acknowledgment of fundamental differences in radiation response mechanisms

For full documentation of the QFT Bridge Model and scientific findings, see [findings.md](findings.md).

## Recent Test Results

Our recent testing has demonstrated several important findings:

1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Our improved QFT Bridge Model successfully handles cross-domain validation with scientifically appropriate tolerances, acknowledging that exact numerical equivalence shouldn't be expected due to fundamental differences in underlying mechanisms.

2. **Linear-Quadratic Model Correction**: Properly implemented the Linear-Quadratic model for biological systems with scientifically validated coefficients, producing the expected non-linear dose response.

3. **Dose-Dependent Response**: Successfully modeled biological dose-response with saturation effects at higher doses, more accurately representing real-world radiobiological observations.

4. **Quantum Enhancement Factors**: Calibrated quantum enhancement factors to biologically and physically realistic ranges (3-5% for biological systems, 8-12% for semiconductors).

5. **Validation Approach**: Implemented a scientific validation methodology that checks whether trends are in agreement rather than expecting exact numeric matching, which better reflects cross-domain scientific understanding.

int main() {
    // 1. Create a biological system (e.g., soft tissue)
    BiologicalSystem tissue;
    tissue.type = SOFT_TISSUE;
    tissue.water_content = 0.7;        // 70% water
    tissue.cell_density = 1.0e6;       // 1 million cells per mm³
    tissue.effective_barrier = 0.3;    // eV
    tissue.repair_rate = 0.3;          // cellular repair capability

    CellularDamageDistribution damage;
    damage["dna_strand_break"] = 0.5;
    damage["protein_damage"] = 0.3;
    damage["membrane_lipid_peroxidation"] = 0.2;
    damage["mitochondrial_damage"] = 0.1;

    // 3. Set environment parameters
    double temperature = 310.0;    // body temperature in K
    double cell_size = 10.0;       // µm
    double radiation_dose = 2.0;   // Gy

    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Common API Usage Examples

### Creating a Radiation Therapy Plan

```cpp
#include <rad_ml/healthcare/radiation_therapy_model.hpp>

// Create a model for lung tissue
RadiationTherapyModel lungModel(SOFT_TISSUE, 0.8, 0.3, 1.2);

// Calculate optimal dose
double optimalDose = lungModel.optimizeRadiationDose(
    1.0,           // min dose (Gy)
    5.0,           // max dose (Gy)
    0.5,           // step size (Gy)
    8.0,           // tumor cell size (µm)
    12.0           // normal cell size (µm)
);

std::cout << "Optimal dose: " << optimalDose << " Gy" << std::endl;

// Calculate therapeutic ratio
double ratio = lungModel.calculateTherapeuticRatio(
    optimalDose,     // tumor dose (Gy)
    0.3 * optimalDose, // normal tissue dose (Gy)
    8.0,             // tumor cell size (µm)
    12.0             // normal cell size (µm)
);

std::cout << "Therapeutic ratio: " << ratio << std::endl;
```

### Using the Cross-Domain Bridge

```cpp
#include <rad_ml/crossdomain/qft_bridge.hpp>

using namespace rad_ml::crossdomain;

// Create semiconductor parameters for testing
SemiconductorParameters silicon;
silicon.energy_gap = 1.12;              // eV
silicon.effective_mass = 0.26;          // m₀
silicon.feature_size = 15.0;            // nm
silicon.defect_formation_energy = 4.0;  // eV
silicon.temperature = 300.0;            // K

// Convert to biological domain
BiologicalParameters bio_params = convertToBiological(silicon);

// Create tissue model using the converted parameters
BiologicalSystem tissue = createBiologicalSystem(bio_params);

// Apply radiation and analyze results
double dose = 2.0; // Gy
RadiationTherapyModel model(tissue);
auto damage = model.predictRadiationDamage(dose, bio_params.cell_size);

// Compare with silicon-domain predictions
auto silicon_error_rate = predictSiliconErrorRate(silicon, dose * convertDoseToFlux(dose));
double bio_error_equiv = convertBiologicalDamageToErrorRate(damage);

std::cout << "Silicon error rate: " << silicon_error_rate << std::endl;
std::cout << "Biological equivalent: " << bio_error_equiv << std::endl;
std::cout << "Translation accuracy: " << (1.0 - std::abs(silicon_error_rate - bio_error_equiv)

lungModel.enableQuantumCorrections(true);
CellularDamageDistribution quantumDamage =
    lungModel.predictRadiationDamage(2.0, 10.0);

// Print the difference
std::cout << "Difference in DNA damage prediction: "
